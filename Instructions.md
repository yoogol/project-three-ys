Sick of looking at those dirty dishes in the sink? Welcome to Roomies, where there are no more resentful roommates.

It's simple. Start by adding a new task: Choose a date and time it should be completed by! How long will the chore take? Cleaning toilets...gross! Mark that one as <italics>extra yucky<italics>!

Claim that chore with the dropdown and watch it move to your board.

Need to change a task you already added? No problem! Just click edit or delete.

When you're done, just check it off and watch your score go up!

Whoever has the most points at the end of each week wins! ...And the loser has to do that week's random punishment.
